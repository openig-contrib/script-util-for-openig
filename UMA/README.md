**Configure automatically your OpenAM for IG documentation test case.**

**STEP-1**: Launch your OpenAM.

**STEP-2**: Open `UMA.groovy` and check that the parameters in the first section, CONFIGURATION, are correct for
your installation. If they are not, change them and save the script.
- Launch the script with the command `$ groovy UMA.groovy`.

The script does the following:
